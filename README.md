# C++ Primer Solutions
My solutions of C++ Primer(5th edition) exercises, including problems that puzzle me. Makefile for visual studio compiler and gcc compiler will be added subsequently.

## Compiler version
```cl```: visual studio 2013, version 18.00.40629

```gcc```: (tdm64-1) 5.1.0

## File Formation
Every chapter is a bipartite collection: one part is solutions of exercises that need programming and another verification of key points that perplex me. Files of the former are named in this way: ```Exer01_01```, where ```01_01``` corresponds to the chapter and exercise number. Some files are named such as ```Exer01_01_1.cpp```, ```Exer01_01_2.cpp```. They correspond to different questions in an exercise. Files of the latter part are named in this way: ```Page001_keypoint.cpp```, where ```001``` the page number and ```keypoint``` is the perplexing key point. Other files such as headers are named according to the requirement in question. Makefile is named as Makefile.
