In this exercise, every class is split into a header and a source file. We can use makefile to compile the whole project, or we can use the command below:
```cpp
gcc -std=c++11 Exer15_39_TextQuery.cpp Exer15_39_AndQuery.cpp Exer15_39_OrQuery.cpp Exer15_39_NotQuery.cpp Exer15_39_Ouery.cpp Exer15_39.cpp -o ./obj/Exer15_39.exe
```
To make separate compilation successful, we have to take care that any header file cannot contain the definition of functions, with some exceptions. One of the exceptions is that ```definitions of inline functions could appear in header file```. Because when we take separate compilation, even if headers are guarded, every header would be compiled into an object file. That is to say, header guards guarantees that if a header is included by A source file multiple times, whether implicitly or explicitly, the header would be processed only once, but header guards cannot guarantee that a header be processed only once if it is included by multiple source files. Thus the definitions of non-inline functions that appear in a header would be processed as many times as the number of source files that include the header. When all of the object files are linked together, compiler wound find multiple definitions of the same function, which caused the link fail. However, inline file may be defined multiple times in the program(see page 240, section 6.5.2), so inline functions could be put in header files.
